Layoffs are typically counted when more than 50 employees are let go from a company for a period of at least 31 days. The occurrence of layoffs can cause anxiety and paranoia among remaining employees, especially if they are struggling to meet their performance goals or arrive to work on time. According to recent statistics, a total of 17 million layoffs have been reported in the United States. Many data has been collected and analyzed on layoffs in the US, including trends, demographics, and industry-specific information. We will examined the details of these statistics in order to provide a thorough understanding of the layoff situation in USA and rest of the world.\n\nNevertheless, tech companies around the world are struggling to deal with the economic downturn. A combination of factors such as reduced consumer spending, increased interest rates from central banks, and a strong US dollar has raised concerns about the possibility of a recession. In response to these challenges, some tech firms have started laying off employees. For example, Meta recently laid off 13% of its workforce, which is over 11,000 people. This data set was created in an effort to allow the Kaggle community to analyze the current challenges facing the tech industry and potentially uncover useful insights.\n\n## Research Questions-\n\n1.

These cities are known for their high concentration of technology companies and are often considered the centers of innovation and growth in the tech industry. However, economic downturns and other factors can lead to layoffs in these areas, resulting in a reduction of the tech workforce in these cities.

However, the company did not publicly disclose the specific breakdown of the layoffs among different departments or job levels. It was rumored that the Recruiting and Business teams were disproportionately affected by the layoffs, but there was no official confirmation of this. It is not known how many employees in the Engineering department were affected by the layoffs, or how many junior and senior employees were impacted.\n\nIt seems that the Recruiting and Engineering departments at a company were particularly affected by recent layoffs. These two departments made up around 50% of the total number of self-reported layoffs. The Engineering department appears to have primarily laid off junior employees, while the Product, Marketing, and Sales departments seem to have mostly laid off senior employees. Of the laid-off engineers, it was stated that 46% will require visa support, which may refer to employees who are not citizens or permanent residents of the country in which the company is located and who are working there on a temporary visa. On the other hand, only 8% of laid-off employees from the Recruiting department are expected to require visa support. It is not clear from the information provided the context or circumstances of the layoffs or the specific reasons for the departmental and job level differences.\n\n## **Total layoffs year

On the other hand, the least amount of layoffs occurred in seed stage companies. This pattern suggests that the companies that were further along in their development and had already gone public were more likely to experience layoffs, while the newer, smaller companies that were still in the early stages of development were less likely to do so.\n\n# **Reflection**\n\nAs someone who had no previous experience with R and no technical background with R language, this class, all the challenges and project were challenging for me. I chose to work with a Layoffs data set because it is the type of data that I am really familiar with since I have looking for a job from a long time and I was up to date with the market since 2019. To begin the analysis, the data set was cleaned and any missing values were handled. This step was important because it allowed for the creation of more accurate figures and calculations. The data was cleaned in order to facilitate this process. Once the data cleaning was completed, further analysis could be conducted.\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects for me was identifying the focus of the data set in terms of cleaning, transforming and visulizing the data, as well as figuring out where to start with the analysis of the data. This was the first time I was doing data analysis, I have mostly worked as a front end developer but never as a data scientist. I decided to focus on the basics of analysis in this project to challenge myself, and if I were to continue with this project, I would look for ways to cross-tabulate the data in more depth, such as by combining many different data points to see different data analysis.\n\nThere were a large number of missing records in the dataset, and the data from 1,300 companies is not sufficient to give us a comprehensive understanding of layoffs. If we could obtain data from at least 10,000 companies, it would be much more useful in terms of understanding the impact of layoffs. One idea I will implement is to compare the data set year by year and observe the yearly layoff trend for the entire world, as well as for the United States alone and for the rest of the world excluding the United States. I will also look at how various industries performed on a yearly basis in India, and by removing data about India from the rest of the world, I will examine the results again to see which fields are consistently performing well or poorly. Another idea is to examine the yearly layoff trends excluding both the United States and India.\n\nOverall, I believe that this project was helpful in allowing me to do the application of what I learned in this class. As I completed the project, I felt that I had gained a basic understanding of the functionality of R and how to structure basic code of R and also how the data analysis works. I found that I was able to approach each challenge more easily as I progressed through the project, although I still feel as though I have only done little bit of R and many more amount to learn. My goal in learning R in depth so I will be able to contribute to the corporate world by learning all functions of R from this class that I am familiar with to read data, filter data, provide specific data, clean data, transform data and very importantly visulize the data. I think all the challenges and speciflcally this project has helped me to develop these skills.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe United States has experienced the highest number of layoffs compared to any other country, with India coming in second. Of all the layoffs that have occurred since 2020, more than 75% have been in the United States. In 2022, the consumer industry in the United States has been the hardest hit by layoffs, while the food industry has been most affected outside the United States. Layoffs have also been seen in the transportation and food industries globally. The travel industry has experienced considerably fewer layoffs globally in 2022 compared to the previous year.\n\nAccording to the [research](https://www.demandsage.com/layoff-statistics/), in the United States, 40% of the population has experienced a layoff at least once in their career. In the past two years, 28% of Americans have reported being laid off from their company. In July 2022, 160 tech companies underwent layoffs. In 2022, there were a total of 2.12 million layoffs recorded in the business and professional services industry. In 2021, there were a total of 17 million layoffs recorded across all industries in the US. The trade and transportation industry saw 1.46 million layoffs between June 2021 and June 2022. Among adults between the ages of 18 and 34, 61% reported experiencing significant pressure and anxiety related to the possibility of being laid off. Women are 25% less likely to be laid off by companies compared to men. In the third quarter of 2022, 23,158 layoffs were recorded. A survey found that 46% of employees felt unprepared for layoffs and separations.\n\nDespite the significant changes and challenges brought about by the coronavirus pandemic, tech companies continue to prioritize engineering talent in their outbound recruitment efforts. It is possible that the pandemic has even intensified this trend, as startups may be focusing more on product development and less on sales and customer success due to slowed customer growth. Previous analysis has shown that tech layoffs have disproportionately affected sales and customer success roles. As a result, tech companies may be able to redirect their resources towards product development initiatives, leading to a sustained demand for engineers.\n\n# **Bibliography**\n\nLayoffs.fyi. (n.d.).
