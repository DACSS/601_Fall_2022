## Challenge Overview

Today's challenge is to:

1.  read in a data set, and describe the data set using both words and any supporting information (e.g., tables, etc)
2.  identify what needs to be done to tidy the current data
3.  anticipate the shape of pivoted data
4.  pivot the data into tidy format using `pivot_longer`

## Read in data

Read in one (or more) of the following datasets, using the correct R package and command.

-   animal_weights.csv ⭐
-   eggs_tidy.csv ⭐⭐ or organiceggpoultry.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   australian_marriage\*.xls ⭐⭐⭐
-   USA Households\*.xlsx ⭐⭐⭐⭐
-   sce_labor_chart_data_public.xlsx 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

```{r}

eggs_tidy <- read_csv('_data/eggs_tidy.csv')
eggs_tidy
```
```{r}
summary(eggs_tidy)
```
### Briefly describe the data

This dataset has 120 rows and 6 columns and describes the prices of different types of eggs from year 2004 to 2013. 4 types of eggs are described - large_half_dozen, large_dozen,  extra_large_half_dozen,  extra_large_dozen. I chose to tidy this dataset because it currently stores the price of 2 types of eggs (large and extra large) for both dozen and half dozen, but all are stored in 4 different columns. It would be better to have one row for one eggs size and quantity. This would help in analysing trends of how the prices different sizes eggs changed over the years and in what quantities.

## Anticipate the End Result

The first step in pivoting the data is to try to come up with a concrete vision of what the end product *should* look like - that way you will know whether or not your pivoting was successful.

One easy way to do this is to think about the dimensions of your current data (tibble, dataframe, or matrix), and then calculate what the dimensions of the pivoted data should be.

Suppose you have a dataset with $n$ rows and $k$ variables. In our example, 3 of the variables are used to identify a case, so you will be pivoting $k-3$ variables into a longer format where the $k-3$ variable names will move into the `names_to` variable and the current values in each of those columns will move into the `values_to` variable. Therefore, we would expect $n * (k-3)$ rows in the pivoted dataframe!

### Example: find current and future data dimensions

Lets see if this works with a simple example.

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: Example

df<-tibble(country = rep(c("Mexico", "USA", "France"),2),
           year = rep(c(1980,1990), 3), 
           trade = rep(c("NAFTA", "NAFTA", "EU"),2),
           outgoing = rnorm(6, mean=1000, sd=500),
           incoming = rlogis(6, location=1000, 
                             scale = 400))
df

#existing rows/cases
nrow(df)

#existing columns/cases
ncol(df)

#expected rows/cases
nrow(df) * (ncol(df)-3)

# expected columns 
3 + 2
```

Or simple example has $n = 6$ rows and $k - 3 = 2$ variables being pivoted, so we expect a new dataframe to have $n * 2 = 12$ rows x $3 + 2 = 5$ columns.

### Challenge: Describe the final dimensions

After pivoting the table, I expect the dataset the dataset to have the month, year, size of the egg and the quantity of the eggs as columns. The resulting dataset will have data 4 times longer. The columns will change from 6 to 5.

```{r}
#existing rows/cases
nrow(eggs_tidy)
#existing columns/cases
ncol(eggs_tidy)
#expected rows/cases
nrow(eggs_tidy) * (ncol(eggs_tidy)-2)

```

Any additional comments?

## Pivot the Data

Now we will pivot the data, and compare our pivoted data dimensions to the dimensions calculated above as a "sanity" check.

### Example

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: Pivoted Example

df<-pivot_longer(df, col = c(outgoing, incoming),
                 names_to="trade_direction",
                 values_to = "trade_value")
df
```

Yes, once it is pivoted long, our resulting data are $12x5$ - exactly what we expected!

### Challenge: Pivot the Chosen Data

As expected, the resulting data is 4 times longer (from 120 -> 480). The number of columns has been reduced by 1 from 6 -> 5. Now, we have a single record of one egg size and quantity per row and helps in easy understanding of data for future analysis.

```{r}
eggs_longer <- eggs_tidy%>%
  pivot_longer(cols=contains("large"),
               names_to = c("Size", "Quantity"),
               names_sep="_",
               values_to = "Cost"
  )
eggs_longer

```

Any additional comments?
Yes, another optimization could be to take an average of the cost of a size and quantity combination for each month for better trend analysis.
